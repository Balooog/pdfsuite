## Summary

Refresh `docs/CONTRIBUTOR_GUIDE.md` so it covers the new GitHub Project board workflow, branch naming, and required status checks.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Document where the board lives, what each column means, and how issues/PRs should move across it.
- [ ] Highlight the CI/status checks that must pass (lint, pytest, smoke, docs) before requesting review.
- [ ] Provide a short “Day 1” checklist for new contributors (fork, create branch, link issue, add to board).

## Notes

- Cross-link to `docs/PROJECT_BOARD.md` and `docs/ROADMAP.md`.
- Mention the `scripts/seed_project_board.sh` helper if contributors want to add similar cards later.
